# 🛠️ MSVC Development Environment

A lightweight, customizable **Windows development environment** for building C/C++ projects using the **Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC)** toolchain — powered by simple and efficient **Batch scripts**.

This setup provides developers with a fast, consistent, and scriptable build workflow, designed for productivity, automation, and clean project organization.

Would you like me to include:
- **Badges** (Build passing, License, Platform, etc.)  
- A **screenshot or ASCII banner** for your terminal environment?  

I can generate a version with those visual elements next to make it even more “world-class.”
